    Stub implementation of ReversiBase.

    This stub implementation behaves according to the following rules:

    - It only supports two players and boards of size 2x2 and above.
    - The board is always initialized with four pieces in the four corners
      of the board. Player 1 has pieces in the northeast and southwest
      corners of the board, and Player 2 has pieces in the southeast and
      northwest corners of the board.
    - All moves are legal, even if there is already a piece in a given position.
    - The game ends after four moves. Whatever player has a piece in position
      (0,1) wins. If there is no piece in that position, the game ends in a tie.
    - It does not validate board positions. If a method
      is called with a position outside the board, the method will likely cause
      an exception.
    - It does not implement the ``load_game`` or ``simulate_moves`` method.
